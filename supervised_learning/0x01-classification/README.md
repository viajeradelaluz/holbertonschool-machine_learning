## More Info

### Matrix Multiplications

For all matrix multiplications in the following tasks, please use [numpy.matmul](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.matmul.html)

### Testing your code

In order to test your code, youâ€™ll need DATA! Please download these datasets ([Binary_Train.npz](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-ml/Binary_Train.npz), [Binary_Dev.npz](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-ml/Binary_Dev.npz), [MNIST.npz](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-ml/MNIST.npz)) to go along with all of the following main files. You do not need to upload these files to GitHub. Your code will not necessarily be tested with these datasets. All of the following code assumes that you have stored all of your datasets in a separate `data` directory.

## Tasks

### 0.Neuron

Write a class `Neuron` that defines a single neuron performing binary classification:

- Main file: `0-main.py`
- class constructor: `def __init__(self, nx)`:
  - `nx` is the number of input features to the neuron
    - If `nx` is not an integer, raise a `TypeError` with the exception: `nx must be an integer`
    - If `nx` is less than 1, raise a `ValueError` with the exception: `nx must be a positive integer`
  - All exceptions should be raised in the order listed above
- Public instance attributes:
  - `W`: The weights vector for the neuron. Upon instantiation, it should be initialized using a random normal distribution.
  - `b`: The bias for the neuron. Upon instantiation, it should be initialized to 0.
  - `A`: The activated output of the neuron (prediction). Upon instantiation, it should be initialized to 0.

### 1. Privatize Neuron

Write a class `Neuron` that defines a single neuron performing binary classification (Based on `0-neuron.py`):

- Main file `1-main.py`
- class constructor: `def __init__(self, nx)`:
  - `nx` is the number of input features to the neuron
    - If `nx` is not an integer, raise a `TypeError` with the exception: `nx must be a integer`
    - If `nx` is less than 1, raise a `ValueError` with the exception: `nx must be positive`
  - All exceptions should be raised in the order listed above
- **Private** instance attributes:
  - `__W`: The weights vector for the neuron. Upon instantiation, it should be initialized using a random normal distribution.
  - `__b`: The bias for the neuron. Upon instantiation, it should be initialized to 0.
  - `__A`: The activated output of the neuron (prediction). Upon instantiation, it should be initialized to 0.
    Each private attribute should have a corresponding getter function (no setter function).

```bash
alexa@ubuntu-xenial:$ ./1-main.py
[[ 1.76405235e+00  4.00157208e-01  9.78737984e-01  2.24089320e+00

### 2. Neuron Forward Propagation

- Write a class `Neuron` that defines a single neuron performing binary classification (Based on `1-neuron.py`):

- Main file: `2-main.py`
- Add the public method `def forward_prop(self, X)`:
  - Calculates the forward propagation of the neuron
  - `X` is a `numpy.ndarray` with shape (`nx`, `m`) that contains the input data
    - `nx` is the number of input features to the neuron
    - `m` is the number of examples
  - Updates the private attribute `__A`
  - The neuron should use a sigmoid activation function
  - Returns the private attribute `__A`

```bash
alexa@ubuntu-xenial:$ ./2-main.py
