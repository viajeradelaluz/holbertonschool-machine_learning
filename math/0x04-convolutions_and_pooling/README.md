# 0x04. Convolutions and Pooling

## Learning Objectives

- What is a convolution?
- What is max pooling? average pooling?
- What is a kernel/filter?
- What is padding?
- What is “same” padding? “valid” padding?
- What is a stride?
- What are channels?
- How to perform a convolution over an image
- How to perform max/average pooling over an image
